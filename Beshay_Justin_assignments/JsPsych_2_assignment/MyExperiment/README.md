Hello!

Within my repository, the folder called JsPsych_2_assignment will lead you to the folder named "MyExperiment"
Here is where the assignment files are held!

experiment.html is where you will find the code for the "Hello World" assignment/tutorial. 
myNewExperiment holds the code for the reaction time assignment. 
  For my myNewExperiment to run, you should download the img folder, which includes the images required to display the orange and blue     
  shapes.   
  Also, Make sure to download and host (import) jspsych on your local repository so that the file can run!
