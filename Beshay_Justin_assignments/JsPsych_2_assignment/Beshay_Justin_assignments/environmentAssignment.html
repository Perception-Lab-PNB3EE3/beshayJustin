<h1>What I learned today</h1>
<p>I learnt how to create my local computing environment. That this is on my local computer hardware and not accesible online to others via the cloud. I also learned how to use my terminal and create html files in a folder. When I preview this file, I basically just learnt how to make a private website! During tutorial I learnt how to connect my github account to my terminal and it was confusing but kinda cool.</p>
