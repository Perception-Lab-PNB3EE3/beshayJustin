        <p>Thank you for taking part in this private study designed for educational purposes. 
        You will be asked to memorize a list of words while either music, white noise, or silence plays in the background. 
        Afterward, you'll complete a brief math distraction task, a waiting room, then recall as many words as possible.</p>
        <p>The study takes approximately 5-10 minutes.</p>
