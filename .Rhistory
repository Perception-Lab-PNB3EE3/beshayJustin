knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
summary(cars)
## Including Plots
You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
plot(pressure)
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

print ("Memory retention is a critical aspect of learning, and various environmental factors, including background noise, can influence recall accuracy. Previous research has produced mixed results on whether listening to music while studying enhances or impairs memory. Some studies suggest that background music can improve concentration and cognitive performance, while others argue that it creates distractions that hinder encoding and retrieval processes.
This study aims to investigate how different types of background noise—silence, white noise, and music—affect recall accuracy and long-term retention of studied material. Specifically, we will examine whether music provides a cognitive benefit, acts as a distractor, or has no effect on memory performance.
The research questions guiding this study are:
Does listening to background music while studying improve, impair, or have no effect on recall accuracy?
How does background noise (e.g., white noise, music, silence) influence long-term retention of studied material?
Participants will study a list of words under one of three noise conditions and will later be tested on their ability to recall the words. The findings may have implications for optimizing study environments for learning and retention.")

print ("Primary Hypothesis (Directional): Participants who study in the silence condition will have higher recall accuracy compared to those in the music and white noise conditions.")
print ("Secondary Hypothesis (Directional): Participants in the music condition will have lower recall accuracy than those in the silence and white noise condition, but the effect will depend on the complexity and familiarity of the music.")
print (" -- High-complexity music (e.g., fast-paced instrumental music, songs with        unpredictable melodies, or multiple layers of sound) will impair recall accuracy more than low-complexity music (e.g., slow instrumental or ambient tracks).")
print ("-- Familiar music will be more distracting than unfamiliar music, as participants may involuntarily sing along or anticipate lyrics, leading to greater cognitive interference with memory encoding and retrieval.")
print ("-- Music with lyrics will be more disruptive to verbal memory tasks than instrumental music, as processing lyrics competes with the cognitive resources required for studying and recall.")
print ("Long-Term Retention Hypothesis (Directional): Participants who study in the silence condition will exhibit better long-term retention of studied material compared to those in the music and white noise conditions.")
print ("Interaction Hypothesis: The impact of background noise on recall accuracy will vary depending on individual differences in study habits (e.g., whether participants frequently listen to music while studying).")

print (" fdsfds" )
print (" This study qualifies as an experiment because it involves direct manipulation of an independent variable—background noise condition—and measures its effect on a dependent variable, recall accuracy. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions (silence, white noise, or music), ensuring that differences in memory performance are due to the experimental manipulation rather than pre-existing individual differences. By controlling for extraneous variables, such as study time and recall delay, and using a standardized procedure across conditions, this study allows for causal inferences about how different types of background noise influence memory retention. The structured design, with controlled exposure times and a fixed delay period before recall, makes it a laboratory-style experiment conducted in a digital setting using jsPsych.")
print ("This study is a single-blind experiment, meaning that participants will be aware of their assigned condition, but the researchers analyzing the data will not know which condition each participant was in.
Participants must be aware of their assigned condition because the independent variable—background noise—directly affects their sensory experience during the study phase. Unlike in pharmaceutical or placebo studies where conditions can be masked, participants actively hear either silence, white noise, or music while studying. Since it is impossible to expose participants to different noise conditions without them noticing, they are inherently aware of their assigned condition. However, to prevent potential bias in data analysis, group assignments (white noise, music, or silence) will concealed from researchers until all statistical analyses are completed.")
print ("This study will use block randomization to assign participants to one of three background noise conditions (silence, white noise, or music). Block randomization ensures that the number of participants in each condition remains balanced throughout the study. Each block will contain an equal number of participants assigned to one of the three conditions. Random assignment will be implemented automatically using a randomization function within jsPsych.")
